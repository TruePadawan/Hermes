## Bio
Hey, I'm Hermes from Lagos, Nigeria. At the moment, I'm building up my knowledge on software development, I currently work mostly with web based technologies like JavaScript, React.js and the likes but I'm really looking forward to checking out any of C#, Kotlin or PHP, less _JavaScript-y_ things, might do that after I'm done with my current project.  

My primary stack includes **JavaScript/TypeScript, Next.js/React.js, SCSS/TailwindCSS, Cypress, Prisma, MongoDB**  

I developed interest in coding around 2019-2020 mainly because I wanted to mess around with Unreal Engine and game development, so I started learning to code with C++ and pretty built up my foundations in programming from there, [I played around with C++/Qt for a while](https://github.com/TruePadawan/Nipsie) before eventually pivoting to web technologies after I got exposed to it while I did Harvard's CS50x, so I've been dealing with web technologies for almost 2 years and so far its been alright but still feel like exploring some other things.  

Currently my daily activities are mostly coding, [gaming](https://steamcommunity.com/id/hermeschi/) and reading (manga/manhwa/fantasy books/studying)  

If you're interested in fantasy books like myself then I suggest these:
- All books by Brandon Mull (I really liked Fablehaven and feel like reading Beyonders and Five Kindgoms again)
- Books by Rick Riodan notably books in the Percy Jackson universe (Percy Jackson, Lost Hero, Trials of Apollo), Sadie and Kane chronicles + Percy Jackson crossover and Magnus chase series
- Mistborn
- Michael Vey
- The Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel

## Bio
Hey, I'm Hermes from Lagos, Nigeria. At the moment, I'm building up my knowledge on software development, I currently work mostly with web based technologies like JavaScript, React.js and the likes but I'm really looking forward to checking out any of C#, Kotlin or PHP, less _JavaScript-y_ things, might do that after I'm done with my current project.  

I developed interest in coding around 2019-2020 mainly because I wanted to mess around with Unreal Engine and game development, so I started learning to code with C++ and pretty built up my foundations in programming from there, [I played around with C++/Qt for a while](https://github.com/TruePadawan/Nipsie) before eventually pivoting to web technologies after I got exposed to it while I did Harvard's CS50x, so I've been dealing with web technologies for almost 2 years and so far its been alright but still feel like exploring some other things.

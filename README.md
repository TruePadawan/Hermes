# Hello there
  My name is Hermes Chigoziri and I'm currently learning C++ programming in hopes of working with the unreal engine software and going into GameDev, I've always loved Computers and Games which is what moved me to start learning how to Code, at the moment i'm still a beginner but i hope to improve with time, at the time of writing this i'm almost done with my first C++ course and i like coding so far and can't wait to improve and be able to create some decent projects, what ever happens..happens, Bye
